        I dont really know how to test my methods since I have used CoreData.
 
     My idea would be to test my Save method to check whether a item has been added to the
     list. i could compare the amount before and after. For last assignment we had A factory of
     all ciphers and we could create a instance of that factory but this time we only TableViewController.
     I dont really know how create such instance.
